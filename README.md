Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project? The SneakerCred Inc. Team
Have you applied for other grants so far? Yes, Received $15,000 in Grant Disbursements of BNB Coin. Won $1,500 in Bounties from the Oasis Game Hackathon from Matic Network, Celer, and CoCos.

A brief description of the project.
Phase(5) Included in Scope of Proposal
Defi: Staking NFT‚Äôs earn rewards in crypto: Medium Article: https://sneakervc.medium.com/nftyco-nfts-backed-by-physical-sneaker-s-4bd2a2462971

The NFTYCO¬Æ collection is a melange of CyberPunk inspired 3D EVA Printable Models and the background inset of the Sneaker Collectible itself has provided a panel for the display of the Artwork.
This is a shoe that is not only the artwork but in and of itself is a tokenized asset that exists as a Backable NFT that can be owned by a ‚Äúdecentralized autonomous org‚Äù like owning stocks and bonds within a shoe. To be able to vote on proposals put forth by the community to do things like AR Gaming.

An indication of how you will integrate this project into Harmony.

Integrate non-fungible tokens (NFT) in our game world in the form of game items. Also, we will add the ability to create and deploy smart contracts by players to enhance their base or automate things. Run mainnet on Harmony and connect to Polkadot as a parachain.

Front End provides a Web UI for everyone to interact with the SNKRDAO network. All the users need to do is open the webpage deployed by the SNKRDAO Labs team or by users themselves and click the buttons following the manual. Front End will provide such functionalities as creating a new DAO, define a new DAO template, withdraw personal assets, voting in DAO, and so on. Front End will be built with NodeJS.
SNKRDAO Token $SNKR is the native token of the SNKRDAO Network, and it will play the role of governance and other utilities. $SNKR is necessary to secure and power the SNKRDAO Network. The SNKRDAO Network may hold an IPO and reward community members for helping our auction with $SNKR tokens during the Parachain Auction.

Template Library is the key component of the SNKRDAO network. It consists of multiple contracts. The main functionalities of Template Library are managing and providing various DAO Templates for different types of organizations. Everyone has the right to define new DAO Templates according to their needs, and the SNKRDAO network provides some default DAO Templates such as Voting Template, Fund Template, SneakerVC (Venture Capital) Template and so on.
Asset Vault is the smart contract providing the basic features of managing assets for each DAO. Working together with DAO Template, the Asset Vault manages all kinds of assets, including the assets needed by creating a new DAO, the assets deposited by the governors of a DAO, and other assets.

An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
We understand that the consumer desires a more customized experience that the larger corporations are too slow and bureaucratic to deliver on. We plan to facilitate and deploy machine learning and neural networks within a peer to peer supply chain of 1000 custom sneaker artisans and match them with our initial snkr token holders to create their sneakrcred‚Äôs in real life with AR features that allow for us to build within the shoes a pokemon Go game play that leverages geo-fencing technology and encourages participation based on location to sports venues and virtual events whereby users can earn snkr tokens and unlock levels within our mini-games as prizes. Leveraging both Apple Glasses AR & Facebook Oculus Open-Source Game Developer toolkits and frameworks as distribution channels. Many sneaker artisans are small businesses that operate sneaker schools to teach other custom sneaker makers how to manufacture their own designs and we intend to leverage those networks as feeders into our onboarding of design partners.
We also see that the sneaker authentication capabilities of NFT‚Äôs is our wedge into becoming the web3 version of StockX and GOAT, as we branch out into other adjacent product lines and partnerships with boutique streetwear fashion brands and designers. We want NFTYCO¬Æ to be the umbrella corporation that can develop the next generation Nike+Pixar+Apple of Consumer facing software integrations with digital fashion. Where blockchains native use-cases for supply-chain, authentication and certification on a native financial layer we can be the ‚ÄúSquare Cash App‚Äù for Sneakerheads who are also into Gaming and onboard them to crypto and unlock the value of digital asset collection and trading platforms better than Ebay/Paypal/Square/Cash/ApplePay.

Project Details
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Sneaker Marketplace & Exchange like ‚ÄúStock X‚Äù
3 months of Engineering
1 month Beta testing
Beta group (manual on-boarding)

4.Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
5. PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic: In 2018, Casmir was awarded a scholarship from Consensys Academy to study and become certified in Ethereum Development, in order to build out an application based on her whitepaper. Upon graduating that program she was invited to participate in a Fellowship program where she used what she learned from Consensys academy to research and design and build a smart contract decentralized application for use in Video games such as NBA2K  in-game assets that mirror the ability for players to actually own their virtual assets outside of the game developer‚Äôs server and leverage those skins and the attributes within the metaverse of decentralized gaming. Based on the strength of SneakrCred demo Teck Chia from Binance Labs offered a paid Fellowship to work on bringing knowledge and execution skills to Binance X to flesh out the Binance Evolution Proposal 7 open source pull request for non-fungible token assets on the Binance Chain a decentralized exchange based on Tendermint. While working on this proposal Cas worked closely with the Cosmos Team and by extension the Ethermint team in Toronto to implement cross-chain transactions of NFT‚Äôs for games. After the completion of Binance Fellowship Casmir recruited a founding team of 4 engineers and we competed and won 3 out of 4 categories in the Game Oasis Hackathon. Casmir was a panelist on the digital collectibles going mainstream at NFT.NYC in February 2020.

Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? No If so, how is your project different? We are the very first digital sneakers on Ethereum & virtual fashion company leveraging blockchain technology as non-fungible collectible game skin assets. We have been very studious about sticking to the real life mirroring of sneaker collecting as a job for some who travel city to city, state to state and sometimes outside of their country to hunt down the most rare and sought after sneakers for their collection and have turned this into a profitable business model to replicate on the blockchain for use in building out the metaverse cross-chain game integrations.
We have built a complementary color matching deterministic algorithm to create ‚Äúsneakr genetics‚Äù as well as incorporated our fan favorite NBA, NCAA, NFL team colors and streetwear brands like Supreme in our colorways to reflect real life trends in streetwear fashion


Sandbox Partnership leverage ERC1155
Blockchain gaming, including DeFi and CrossFi.
Harmony intends to become one of the first Proof-of-Stake layer 1 blockchain that will enable high-speed trading of NFTs among its community, and commits to supporting the growth and audience development of blockchain gaming by building bridges between Harmony and Ethereum ‚Äî supporting NFT standards such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155 on Harmony. The Sandbox is one of the 3 main contributors to the ERC-1155 standard together with Enjin and Horizon Games.
A key feature of The Sandbox decentralized gaming platform is the ability for anyone to make his own NFTs with VoxEdit. . . These NFTs can then be utilized within The Sandbox‚Äôs game maker, but also by other dApps, platforms and now blockchains as well! I‚Äôm thrilled to see major blockchain actors such as Harmony and their tech team work on enabling true interoperability of the NFTs by bridging them in and out of Ethereum. This is a major step forward towards increasing the utility (thus potentially value) of the NFTs and their liquidity into other chains.

Problem: Creating an NFT is insanely technical for most creatives.
Identify the Scope. ...The scope defines the boundaries of a project, what features will be included and implemented within this scope, what is the delivery dates and milestones need to be delivered as well the required budget to deliver that scope. If the project is poorly controlled and governed, then the scope creep is expected.
NFT module(s). NFTs can be separate by domains in which case each domain would be its own NFT module (e.g. x/kitties_nft) or we could have one domain-agnostic NFT module
721 that's already been tested as useful. Most of 1155 is about increasing the gas efficiency of 721 and opinions about combining registries of erc-20 and erc-721. These features don't really apply to an SDK NFT.
I think the biggest change between an Ethereum based NFT and an SDK NFT is the ability to store much more Metadata on chain. Because storage on ETH is shared across all participants it's expensive and so the solution was to put metadata off chain and just include a tokenURI endpoint that returns an RFC 3986 URI‚Äîtypically http(s) or ipfs. That URI returns a JSON object with information about that NFT. This makes it difficult for that information to be accessed and used for on-chain transactions. This could be a problem if for example the NFT were an asset like a Centrifuge-style invoice where the contents of the invoice are only represented by a hash but another on chain transaction needs access to actual data in that invoice‚Äîmaybe hourly rate. You'd need an oracle to confirm that content if it lived off-chain but with an SDK chain it can be readily accessible.
I think this feature should be supported by modifying the 721 spec where the tokenURI doesn't return the URI but the actual metadata resource itself. This resource may elect to contain a tokenURI that points to off-chain data, in case storage of such data does in fact make more sense off-chain. However it also enables onchain data to be accessible in a predictable format in case it is deemed useful on chain.
The following methods from the 721 standard would need to become Msg Types:
transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data)
This is a transfer function that includes the ability to transfer an asset on behalf of another user. We'd need to keep track of allowances so that a user would be able to give permission to another party to move assets on their behalf. This might be necessary for pegs as well‚Äìmaybe the permission includes chain-ids as well?
approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId)
This would be a necessary component of transferFrom to approve transfers on behalf of other parties.
setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved)
Variation of approve to allow multiple approvals at once
safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)
This version of TransferFrom checks with the party receiving the NFT to confirm they are prepared to accept the asset or whether they have an action that should be performed upon receiving it. Maybe out of scope for first Cosmo NFT spec but also good to consider this. Maybe we'd have a registry of recipients who can decide whether they accept an NFT sent to them or reject it?
safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data)
This is a variation of safeTransferFrom without a data parameter. This data parameter is used to daisy-chain arbitrary on chain transactions. Something similar might be another Msg type that might want to be executed directly following the first transaction. QUESTION: Is it possible to create arbitrary transaction that bundle multiple MsgTypes? Maybe for 1st draft this implementation should not be reproduced on Cosmos.* safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data)
The following queriers would need to be created from the 721 spec:
balanceOf(address _owner)
Number of NFTs the address owns
ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)
Owner address of a specific NFT
getApproved(uint256 _tokenId)
If transferFrom includes the ability to move on behalf of others it would be necessary to check the approvals
isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator)
An extension to the ability to check for approvals
The Metadata spec is actually separated from the required fields of the NFT. This might also be good to make optional with a reference to whether or not they exist. Something like EIP 165 would be needed for that and should also be considered. In the meantime we would expect the following queries for metadata:
name()
Return a string for the NFT family name
symbol()
Return a string for the NFT family symbol
tokenURI
This should be replaced with an actual metadata data object. Even if all data is stored off chain the tokenURI for that data could be contained within the returned data object.
metadata
This would return an object with a minimum of the ERC-721 metadata scheme, plus optional additional info under tokenURI. The return format may be a parameter so that if the recipient is prepared to parse JSON they can do so, but may also be able to request it with a different serialization.
{
    "title": "Asset Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "image": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
        },
        "tokenURI": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with more token related metadata that doesn't belong on chain."
        }
    }
}
 
It might also be useful to have more Cosmos specific information per NFT. Maybe a parameter for origin chain? If the specific token is being held across chains, maybe it would be good to distinguish which NFTs are being held by users and which are being held by validator sets. If the asset is being held by a validator set it would be good to be able to tell whether a user holds the wrapped version of the NFT on the other side of the validator set.
 
If the purpose of tokenURI within the metadata query is to provide an extension to the on-chain metadata, perhaps it's best to just call it extension, so that implementers can do something like
const resolvedMetadata = {
   ...metadata,
   ...(await resolveExtendedMetadata(metadata.extension))
}
 
and call it a day.
I'd also make the metadata spec enforce the presence of name for no other reason than "it'd be nice if everything could be guaranteed to have a name"
Totally agree but think @jackzampolin is right here that the chain-id should function the exact same way. I'd love to see a global registry of chain-id and NFTs but I think that's out of scope for the standard. We should also be seeing systems come into place for keeping track of origin chains across IBC communication. Again I think this should be part of another spec related to Inter-Blockchain Communication.
It may be worth to simply allow for multiple NFT wallets under the same key.
basically entail that we allow the meta-data to optionally be stored on-chain or off-chain on a platform like IPFS (whereby the protocol would retrieve the metadata from the 3rd party)
each NFT should be able to define custom mint and burn logic which could occur on a blockly basis, and be able to register that logic through the NFT interface. In this way Mint and Burn rules would typically be defined at the App level then registered with NFT - during the NFT endblock or beginblock custom registered logic would be executed
Regarding metadata. Yes. It is a very simple and powerful way to connect tokens to the real world (i.e. things with URIs).
We've been using ERC-1155 for non-fungibles intensively by separating the token ID bits into a base ID and an index, please see the section on this here:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md#non-fungible-tokens
If some NFTs needs to be fungible there should be an app-specific method to do so. You could simply "burn" the NFTs and mint new fungible tokens that represent them. They can be bought and sold in quantities as fungible tokens and then redeemed for NFTs later on if need be.
ERC-721-like tokens. Essentially like rewards points with equal value, but different metadata like expiration, transferability date etc.
This interface is designed for use with token contracts that have an "ID" domain, such as ERC-1155 or ERC-721. This enables restricted approval of one or more Token IDs to a specific "scope". When considering a smart contract managing tokens from multiple different domains, it makes sense to limit approvals to those domains. Scoped approval is a generalization of this idea. Implementers can define scopes as needed.
Sample use cases for scopes:
A company may represent it's fleet of vehicles on the blockchain and it could create a scope for each regional office.
Game developers could share an ERC-1155 contract where each developer manages tokens under a specified scope.
Tokens of different value could be split into separate scopes. High-value tokens could be kept in smaller separate scopes while low-value tokens might be kept in a shared scope. Users would approve the entire low-value token scope to a third-party smart contract, exchange, or other application without concern about losing their high-value tokens in the event of a problem.
Motivation
It may be desired to restrict approval in some applications. Restricted approval can prevent losses in cases where users do not audit the contracts they're approving. No standard API is supplied to manage scopes as this is implementation specific. Some implementations may opt to offer a fixed number of scopes, or assign a specific set of scopes to certain types. Other implementations may open up scope configuration to its users and offer methods to create scopes and assign IDs to them.

Localization
Metadata localization should be standardized to increase presentation uniformity across all languages. As such, a simple overlay method is proposed to enable localization. If the metadata JSON file contains a localization attribute, its content may be used to provide localized values for fields that need it. The localization attribute should be a sub-object with three attributes: uri, default and locales. If the string {locale} exists in any URI, it MUST be replaced with the chosen locale by all client software.
Rationale
The initial design was proposed as an extension to ERC-1155: Discussion Thread - Comment 1. After some discussion: Comment 2 and suggestions by the community to implement this approval mechanism in an external contract Comment 3, it was decided that as an interface standard, this design would allow many different token standards such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155 to implement scoped approvals without forcing the system into all implementations of the tokens.
Metadata JSON
The Scope Metadata JSON Schema was added in order to support human-readable scope names and descriptions in more than one language.

As such, as a requirement, it would be a functional requirement. Performance, say, of login, is a non-functional requirement: a judgement of the quality of the implementation (rather than a feature is present/absent).

Listen to your favorite playlists and unlock new Drops as you walk around and explore. Unlock new collectible colorways & color pallets, earn crypto for counting your steps.
The geotag regional location, certainly, the sneaker design so if you release the warrior sneakercred GO Game you can you restrict the sneakers. To within the Warriors 100 -700 miles miles of the chase center, whatever. So, only people there can collect and combine them, on the train and people with their warriors' gear. we could send out like nearby me. If you're in this Reddit group or discord channel I know a discord, they have like five friends nearby feature.

 Warriors The Warriors, you show up within a 100-yard radius of the Warriors stadium at this time and you can get a warriors little bit for your shoes.just the colors we can exactly go warriors golden blue boom you just captured blue and yellow capture the colors by coated the team places. trade colors you should see that there's another level to it right there. Yeah, not just the shoes but make the colors trader. 
Don't give every doesn't give everybody a full palette.
 they won't be able to unlock all of the panels that issue panels, you might only have like, you know, one level when you first start up for two levels or something. levels like premium levels go level several levels.

Proxy Admin Contract
Open Zeppelin Creates an intermediary ProxyAdmin contract
That is in charge of all the proxies you create via the upgrades plugins 
Even if you call the deploy command from your nodes default account the 
ProxyAdmin  contract will be the actual admin of all your proxies.

Make sure your contracts are initializer functions instead of constructors

Always extend storage instead of modifying it

Transparent Proxy Pattern 
As described: upgradeable contract instances: proxies work by delegating all calls to a logic contract. Context?

However the proxies need some functions of their own, such as upgradeTo(address) to upgrade to a new implementation.

Clashing can also happen among functions with different names. Every function that is part of a contracts public ABI is identified, at the Byte Code level 4 bytes identifier.
This identifier depends on the name and arity of the function, but since its only 4 bytes there is a possibility that the two different functions with different names may end up having the same identifier. The solidity compiler does not track when the collision happens across a proxy and it‚Äôs logic contract.

EIP 1967 Randomize storage
The call data is copied to memory 
The call data is forwarded to the logic contract
The return data from the call to the logic contract is retrieved
The return data is forwarded back to the caller.

NOTE: delegate call opcode which executes the callees code of the caller‚Äôs state. The state is in the proxy and the logic is in the particular implementation that the proxy points to.
That is , the logic contract controls the proxy‚Äôs state and the logic contracts state is meaningless.
Proxy: fallback function
assembly {
	Let ptr:=mload(0x40)
caldatacopy(ptr,0,calldatasize)
	Let result := deletecall(gas, _impl,ptr,calldatasize,0,0)
Let result := returndatasize
returndatacopy(ptr,0,size)

Switch result
Case 0 {revert(ptr,size)}
default{return(ptr,size)}

}
Thus, the proxy doesn‚Äôt only forward transactions to and from the logic contract, but also represents the pairs.
The defender admin backend is only involved in storing proposal metadata and sharing the approval signatures when these areas are not stored on chain function.

The ERC721 Enumerable is where the _setTokenURI method comes from.We use it to store an item's Metadata.
TokenURI JSON

	‚ÄúName‚Äù: ‚ÄúOriginal‚Äù

}
Gas Station Network GSN ‚ÄúMagic Minting‚Äù
An upgrade auction can only be executed on EIP1967-compatible or legacy zOS upgradeable proxies that expose an upgradeTo(address)
Defender Admin will handle proxies directly owned by a multisignature wallet or proxies managed by a proxy Admin that is in turn owned by the wallet: EIP1559
The upgrade action only requires you choose the new implementation address, and defender Admin takes care of the rest.

Libraries 
Some of our Solidity libraries use structs to handle internal data that should not be access directly(eg. Roles).
There‚Äôs: This we will use leading underscores and make said structs to make it clear to the user that its contents and layout are not part of the API.

Gas Costs
In particular users should not assume gas costs will not increase when upgrading library versions.

Library definitions 
Sighash List: 
Storage is a hast table or simple dictionary it will ‚Äú.‚Äù concatenate the slot of the mapping value(in this case the number 1, because it‚Äôs the 2nd variable declared in the contract with the key used (in this case, msg.sender, caller obtained within the opcode ‚Äúcaller‚Äù) the hash that w/the SHA3 opcode and use that as the target position in storage msg.sender address is stored in memory(this time at position 0x00) mapping this is precisely where the value 10000 store(hash‚Ä¶, 0x2710)

	What to Store
Where to Store
	The value 1(slot if the mapping) is stored at memory position 0x20 finally the SHA3 opcode calculates the keccak256 hash of whatever is in memory from position 0x00 to position 0x40 the concatenation of the mapping‚Äôs slot/position w/the key used.
Layout of CallData
The ABI specification requires org to be padded to multiples of 32 bytes. The internal function call uses a different conversion.
When Solidity contract is deployed and when its called from an account the input data is assumed to be in the format of:
				The run-time code copy structure
The EVM will execute the code and the RETURN value as the created contract‚Äôs runtime code.
This is what makes the constructor function of a contract so special in Solidity.
The Solidity compiler is agnostic in terms of the system to store contract metadata.
The metadata hash can be found in the last few opcodes of the runtime byte code of a contract.
That code wasn‚Äôt supposed to be executed by the EVM either; it was just there as a sort of hack to store the initialization values of a contract for consumption in constructors.
WE want:  EVM instruction 	Short Explanation
Parse data: CALLDATACOPY received from caller:	calldata is the data sent to the contract in the transaction so we need to copy that into memory to be able to later forward it.

Magic Minting 
Magic Minting allows creators to create NFT‚Äôs w/o having to pay any Ethereum Gas Fees, or submit an Ethereum Transaction.
Creators can pay $1.99 w/a credit card and create an NFT. The original Creator is noted in the NFT Metadata. The ethereum wallet address that you use to sign up on NFTYCO still has full control of the NFTY.
You can also immediately add the NFT to the NFTYCO¬Æ marketplace all w/o ever needing any ETH in your wallet or paying an Tx Fee when the NFT is sold the funds will be auto-matically transferred to the wallet associated w/your NFTYCO account.

Localization
Metadata localization should be standardized to increase presentation uniformity across all languages. As such, a simple overlay method is proposed to enable localization. If the metadata JSON file contains a localization attribute, its content MAY be used to provide localized values for fields that need it. The localization attribute should be a sub-object with three attributes: uri, default and locales. If the string {locale} exists in any URI, it MUST be replaced with the chosen locale by all client software.

Community engagement
As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on Medium).
It should explain your work done as part of the grant.

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant,
although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

Phase One: Ranked #1 on OpenSea 1st week sales Volume upon Launch: We proved our thesis buy generating $6,000 in sales and $3,000 in re-sales and referrals via web-application built as a proof of concept MVP as a two-person engineer team at Insight Founders Labs in January 2020 where we:
Launched #1 on OpenSea to much fanfare a limited Drop of 23 2D Blank Template ‚ÄúEth-Aireum SneakrCred‚Äôs‚Äù designed by our in house designer John Intek and have a lineup of design partners that will sell their work through our process. With the initial ‚ÄúCustoms‚Äù Drop implementing our genetic color matching algorithm where we programmatically designed with shoe panels with software we developed in our application where we sold over 152 ‚Äúsneakrs‚Äù with a highest selling price of $1,028 and an average selling price of $50, we witnessed a bidding war during the auction and saw some ‚Äúsneakr‚Äôs‚Äù resale for an average price of $172 dollars which proved our thesis that there is an analogy of sneaker collecting in the physical world.
We have a core of early adopters that are very loyal and eager to help us continue our viral growth within the larger collector community. We also have Partnerships with OpenSea and Known Origin who are fans of our product and of our visionary goal of being the very 1st digital sneaker company to go to market. 
Phase Two: Needs our own payment portal to onboard sneaker artisans and collectors via NFTYCO Academy. Big guys like Nike via OpenSea are trying to kill our business because they are trying to push their own product by blacklisting our diverse product offerings by banning our smart-contracts. In order to do that we have recruited a Senior Infrastructure Engineer from Google Ads & Live Peer who has a strong background in infrastructure  as we see the natural progression of digital product offerings with ads promoted as NFT‚Äôs, A Game Developer to make mini-games that utilize our 3D sneaker NFT‚Äôs in various games that imagine sneakers as cars racing, scavenger hunts, and first person shooter games. We‚Äôve added security and devops as well as hired operations and social media managers to direct the business development and partnerships for our next phase of growth.
