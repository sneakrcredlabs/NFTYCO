An indication of how you will integrate this project into Harmony.

Integrate non-fungible tokens (NFT) in our game world in the form of game items. Also, we will add the ability to create and deploy smart contracts by players to enhance their base or automate things. Run mainnet on Harmony and connect to Polkadot as a parachain.

Front End provides a Web UI for everyone to interact with the SNKRDAO network. All the users need to do is open the webpage deployed by the SNKRDAO Labs team or by users themselves and click the buttons following the manual. Front End will provide such functionalities as creating a new DAO, define a new DAO template, withdraw personal assets, voting in DAO, and so on. Front End will be built with NodeJS.
SNKRDAO Token $SNKR is the native token of the SNKRDAO Network, and it will play the role of governance and other utilities. $SNKR is necessary to secure and power the SNKRDAO Network. The SNKRDAO Network may hold an IPO and reward community members for helping our auction with $SNKR tokens during the Parachain Auction.

Template Library is the key component of the SNKRDAO network. It consists of multiple contracts. The main functionalities of Template Library are managing and providing various DAO Templates for different types of organizations. Everyone has the right to define new DAO Templates according to their needs, and the SNKRDAO network provides some default DAO Templates such as Voting Template, Fund Template, SneakerVC (Venture Capital) Template and so on.
Asset Vault is the smart contract providing the basic features of managing assets for each DAO. Working together with DAO Template, the Asset Vault manages all kinds of assets, including the assets needed by creating a new DAO, the assets deposited by the governors of a DAO, and other assets.

An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
We understand that the consumer desires a more customized experience that the larger corporations are too slow and bureaucratic to deliver on. We plan to facilitate and deploy machine learning and neural networks within a peer to peer supply chain of 1000 custom sneaker artisans and match them with our initial snkr token holders to create their sneakrcred‚Äôs in real life with AR features that allow for us to build within the shoes a pokemon Go game play that leverages geo-fencing technology and encourages participation based on location to sports venues and virtual events whereby users can earn snkr tokens and unlock levels within our mini-games as prizes. Leveraging both Apple Glasses AR & Facebook Oculus Open-Source Game Developer toolkits and frameworks as distribution channels. Many sneaker artisans are small businesses that operate sneaker schools to teach other custom sneaker makers how to manufacture their own designs and we intend to leverage those networks as feeders into our onboarding of design partners.
We also see that the sneaker authentication capabilities of NFT‚Äôs is our wedge into becoming the web3 version of StockX and GOAT, as we branch out into other adjacent product lines and partnerships with boutique streetwear fashion brands and designers. We want NFTYCO¬Æ to be the umbrella corporation that can develop the next generation Nike+Pixar+Apple of Consumer facing software integrations with digital fashion. Where blockchains native use-cases for supply-chain, authentication and certification on a native financial layer we can be the ‚ÄúSquare Cash App‚Äù for Sneakerheads who are also into Gaming and onboard them to crypto and unlock the value of digital asset collection and trading platforms better than Ebay/Paypal/Square/Cash/ApplePay.

4.Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
5. PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic: In 2018, Casmir was awarded a scholarship from Consensys Academy to study and become certified in Ethereum Development, in order to build out an application based on her whitepaper. Upon graduating that program she was invited to participate in a Fellowship program where she used what she learned from Consensys academy to research and design and build a smart contract decentralized application for use in Video games such as NBA2K  in-game assets that mirror the ability for players to actually own their virtual assets outside of the game developer‚Äôs server and leverage those skins and the attributes within the metaverse of decentralized gaming. Based on the strength of SneakrCred demo Teck Chia from Binance Labs offered a paid Fellowship to work on bringing knowledge and execution skills to Binance X to flesh out the Binance Evolution Proposal 7 open source pull request for non-fungible token assets on the Binance Chain a decentralized exchange based on Tendermint. While working on this proposal Cas worked closely with the Cosmos Team and by extension the Ethermint team in Toronto to implement cross-chain transactions of NFT‚Äôs for games. After the completion of Binance Fellowship Casmir recruited a founding team of 4 engineers and we competed and won 3 out of 4 categories in the Game Oasis Hackathon. Casmir was a panelist on the digital collectibles going mainstream at NFT.NYC in February 2020.

Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? No If so, how is your project different? We are the very first digital sneakers on Ethereum & virtual fashion company leveraging blockchain technology as non-fungible collectible game skin assets. We have been very studious about sticking to the real life mirroring of sneaker collecting as a job for some who travel city to city, state to state and sometimes outside of their country to hunt down the most rare and sought after sneakers for their collection and have turned this into a profitable business model to replicate on the blockchain for use in building out the metaverse cross-chain game integrations.
We have built a complementary color matching deterministic algorithm to create ‚Äúsneakr genetics‚Äù as well as incorporated our fan favorite NBA, NCAA, NFL team colors and streetwear brands like Supreme in our colorways to reflect real life trends in streetwear fashion

Current Traction. Including: https://www.sneakrcred.com/sneakrs
Phase One: Ranked #1 on OpenSea 1st week sales Volume upon Launch: We proved our thesis buy generating $6,000 in sales and $3,000 in re-sales and referrals via web-application built as a proof of concept MVP as a two-person engineer team at Insight Founders Labs in January 2020 where we:
Launched #1 on OpenSea to much fanfare a limited Drop of 23 2D Blank Template ‚ÄúEth-Aireum SneakrCred‚Äôs‚Äù designed by our in house designer John Intek and have a lineup of design partners that will sell their work through our process. With the initial ‚ÄúCustoms‚Äù Drop implementing our genetic color matching algorithm where we programmatically designed with shoe panels with software we developed in our application where we sold over 152 ‚Äúsneakrs‚Äù with a highest selling price of $1,028 and an average selling price of $50, we witnessed a bidding war during the auction and saw some ‚Äúsneakr‚Äôs‚Äù resale for an average price of $172 dollars which proved our thesis that there is an analogy of sneaker collecting in the physical world.
We have a core of early adopters that are very loyal and eager to help us continue our viral growth within the larger collector community. We also have Partnerships with OpenSea and Known Origin who are fans of our product and of our visionary goal of being the very 1st digital sneaker company to go to market. 
Phase Two: Needs our own payment portal to onboard sneaker artisans and collectors via NFTYCO Academy. Big guys like Nike via OpenSea are trying to kill our business because they are trying to push their own product by blacklisting our diverse product offerings by banning our smart-contracts. In order to do that we have recruited a Senior Infrastructure Engineer from Google Ads & Live Peer who has a strong background in infrastructure  as we see the natural progression of digital product offerings with ads promoted as NFT‚Äôs, A Game Developer to make mini-games that utilize our 3D sneaker NFT‚Äôs in various games that imagine sneakers as cars racing, scavenger hunts, and first person shooter games. We‚Äôve added security and devops as well as hired operations and social media managers to direct the business development and partnerships for our next phase of growth.

TrapCha.in assumes the network is constantly under attack of DDOS and therefore does not seek to ‚ÄúValidate and Store State‚Äù but Only holds a public ledger of Malicious Attack Vector addresses and stores them in a Blacklist Smart Contract and therefore doesn‚Äôt keep a record of valid transactions only the ones that have been slashed or ‚ÄúViolates the consensus‚Äù. Thus crafting a smaller more nimble protocol based on Zero-knowledge proofs and Violatr Nodes. 
Node Operators earn ‚Äútrapcoin‚Äù for vigilance in violating bad actors and thus the reward system is robust against attackers because the assumption is that it is always under attack for safety and security precautions as opposed to the idealism and utopic validators and turns every node into a Violator node constantly raising the bar on effectively re-structuring the security acumen of nodes.
